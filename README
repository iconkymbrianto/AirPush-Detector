AirPush Detector iconkymr

This is a simple Android application which detects other installed
applications which appear to use the AirPush ad framework and a few
other known notification ad frameworks.

This app is obsoleted by Android 4.1, which provides a means of
identifying the source of a notification natively - this app is
provided mainly for earlier Android versions without such a feature.
